# weather
This project was challenging but fun. We had to use server-side apis to create a weather dashboard. The Open weather documentation had the calls for the current forecast, 5day forecast, and Uv Index. Using Ajax calls I was able to drill down and get the exact documentation that I needed. 

Technologies Used:
1) Javascript
2)HTML
3) https://openweathermap.org/api
4) Bootstrap
5) moment.js
6) github
